# Boston-Home-Price-Index-Forecast

### 1  Introduction 

Although the price change of any particular house is difficult to predict, the overall house price change is predictable. Over the past few decades, academic interest in real estate market modeling and forecasting has expanded (Case and Shiller, 1990; Zhou, 1997; Barras, 2009; Brooks and Tsolacos, 2010). 

This project utilize R to compare the forecasting performance of two types of time series models: ARIMA, Holt's Linear Trend Model and compared them with baseline models. In conclusion, ARIMA model performs better in out-of-sample forecasting.

### 3  Conclusion 

ARIMA is the best model. It has the lowest validation RMSE, and according to Diebold/Mariano tests, it outperforms all other models. As the results of the study suggest, ARIMA is a useful technique to assess broad market price changes. Government and central bank can use ARIMA modelling approach to forecast national house price inflation. Developers can employ this methodology to drive successful house-building programme. Investor can incorporate forecasts from ARIMA models into investment strategy for timing purposes.
