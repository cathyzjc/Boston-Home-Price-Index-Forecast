# Boston-Home-Price-Index-Forecast
 
Although the price change of any particular house is difficult to predict, the overall house price change is predictable. Over the past few decades, academic interest in real estate market modeling and forecasting has expanded (Case and Shiller, 1990; Zhou, 1997; Barras, 2009; Brooks and Tsolacos, 2010). 

This project utilize R to compare the forecasting performance of two types of time series models: ARIMA, Holt's Linear Trend Model and compared them with baseline models. In conclusion, ARIMA model performs better in out-of-sample forecasting.
